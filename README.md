# Search-Engine-Project

## Project Overview

This project involves designing and developing a fully functional search engine using PHP and MySQL. The search engine will be capable of fetching and displaying data stored in a MySQL database, allowing users to search for specific content. The project also includes handling image uploads and displaying them in search results.

## Project Features

Search Engine from Scratch: Build a search engine using PHP and MySQL, starting from the ground up.

Data Fetching: Implement functionality to retrieve data from a MySQL database based on user queries.

Data Insertion: Create a feature to insert website or content details into the database and dynamically display them back to users.

Dynamic Pages: Develop search result pages that dynamically display content based on user input.

Image Handling: Implement functionality for uploading images and displaying them within the search results.

## Project Components

insert_site.php: A PHP page that allows the insertion of data into the MySQL database.

search.html: A front-end page where users can input their search queries.

results.php: The PHP logic that fetches and displays the search results from the database.

Database (search): A MySQL database designed to store searchable content.

Database Table (sites): A table within the search database to store details of websites or other searchable content.

Root Folder (search-engine): The main directory containing all project files.

Images Folder (images): A folder within the main directory to store uploaded images.

## Tools & Technologies

PHP: Server-side scripting language used to build the backend of the search engine.

MySQL: Database management system used to store and retrieve search data.

HTML/CSS: Used for designing the user interface of the search engine.

JavaScript: Enhances interactivity and improves user experience on the front end.

Google Chrome: The browser used for testing and viewing the web pages.

VSCode: The code editor used for writing and managing the project's codebase.

GitHub: Version control system to track changes and collaborate on the project.

OnRender: A platform used for deploying the search engine, making it accessible online.

## Getting Started

Clone the Repository: Use GitHub to clone the repository to your local machine.

## Set Up the Database:

Create a MySQL database named search.
Create a table named sites within this database to store website/content details.
Configure the Project:

Set up the insert_site.php page to insert data into the sites table.
Design the search.html page as the main interface for user searches.
Implement the results.php page to fetch and display search results dynamically.

Test and Deploy:

Test the project locally using Google Chrome.
Deploy the project on OnRender for online access.

## Future Enhancements

Advanced Search Options: Add filters and sorting options to refine search results.

User Authentication: Implement login and registration functionality for personalized search experiences.

Real-time Data Fetching: Use AJAX for real-time search suggestions as users type their queries.
